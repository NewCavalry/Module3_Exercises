    <!-- I keep getting confused about elements and attributes so here's a little more:  HTML elements are simply objects that sit on your web page. And stacked together, they construct your web page. But what about HTML attributes...what are they?

An HTML attribute is simply a further definition of an HTML element. Said another way, attributes allow you to add additional properties to HTML elements.
